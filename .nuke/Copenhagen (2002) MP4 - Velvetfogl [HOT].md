One of the main themes of Copenhagen is the uncertainty and ambiguity of human memory and motivation. The play is structured as a series of conflicting and contradictory accounts of what happened during the meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr, as well as their personal and professional histories. The characters constantly question each other's motives, intentions, and actions, and try to reconstruct the past from their own perspectives. The play also explores the concept of quantum mechanics, which suggests that reality is indeterminate and dependent on observation. The play implies that there is no definitive truth or objective reality, but only multiple possibilities and interpretations.
 
Another theme of Copenhagen is the morality and responsibility of science in a time of war. The play examines the ethical dilemmas faced by Heisenberg and Bohr, who were both involved in the development of nuclear physics and weapons. The play raises questions about the role of scientists in society, their obligations to their countries, their colleagues, and humanity, and their accountability for the consequences of their discoveries. The play also explores the impact of war on personal relationships, as Heisenberg and Bohr were once close friends but became estranged due to their political affiliations and scientific rivalries. The play shows how war can destroy trust, friendship, and communication, and create fear, suspicion, and guilt.
