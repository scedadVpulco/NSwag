# Rosen Digital Studio Guitar Impulses: A Review by Oddsox
 
If you are looking for some high-quality guitar impulses to spice up your tone, you might want to check out Rosen Digital Studio Guitar Impulses. These are a collection of professionally recorded cabinet and microphone combinations that can be used with any amp simulator or direct input signal. In this review, I will share my experience with using these impulses and how they compare to other products on the market.
 
First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of Rosen Digital products. I have used their bass impulses and their acoustic guitar impulses in the past and I was always impressed by their quality and realism. So when I heard that they released a new pack of studio guitar impulses, I was eager to try them out. I downloaded the pack from their website and installed it on my computer. The pack contains 10 different cabinet models, each with 6 different microphone options. That gives you a total of 60 impulses to choose from. You can also mix and match different cabinets and microphones to create your own custom combinations.

The first thing I noticed when I loaded up one of the impulses was how clear and balanced it sounded. The impulses have a very natural and organic tone, without any harshness or muddiness. They also have a lot of depth and dimension, making them sound like they were recorded in a real studio environment. The impulses respond very well to different playing styles and dynamics, giving you a lot of flexibility and expression. You can easily go from clean to crunch to high gain tones with just a few tweaks on your amp simulator.

The second thing I noticed was how well the impulses matched the original cabinet models. I compared some of the impulses to the actual cabinets that I own or have used before, and I was amazed by how close they sounded. The impulses captured all the nuances and characteristics of each cabinet, such as the resonance, the frequency response, and the speaker breakup. The impulses also sounded very consistent across different amp simulators, so you don't have to worry about compatibility issues.
 
The third thing I noticed was how versatile and diverse the impulses were. The pack covers a wide range of genres and styles, from classic rock to metal to blues to jazz. You can find an impulse for any situation or mood that you are in. Whether you want a warm and smooth tone, a bright and punchy tone, or a dark and heavy tone, you can find it in this pack. The impulses also work great for both rhythm and lead playing, as well as for different types of guitars.
 
Overall, I am very impressed by Rosen Digital Studio Guitar Impulses. They are some of the best guitar impulses that I have ever used and they have become my go-to choice for recording and mixing guitar tracks. They are easy to use, realistic, and versatile. They are also very affordable, considering the quality and quantity that you get. If you are looking for some new guitar impulses to enhance your tone, I highly recommend that you give these a try. You won't regret it.
