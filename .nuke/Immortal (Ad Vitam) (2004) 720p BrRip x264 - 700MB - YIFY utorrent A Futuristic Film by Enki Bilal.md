Immortal (Ad Vitam) is a 2004 French film that combines live-action and animation to create a futuristic world where ancient gods and genetically modified humans coexist. The film is loosely based on the comic book La Foire aux immortels (The Carnival of Immortals) by Enki Bilal, who also directed and co-wrote the film. The film stars Linda Hardy, Thomas Kretschmann and Charlotte Rampling.

The film's plot revolves around Horus, an Egyptian god who is sentenced to lose his immortality and die by his fellow gods. He has only seven days to find a human host and a woman who can bear his child, which is the only way to save himself. He chooses Nikopol, a rebel leader who has escaped from a cryogenic prison, as his host, and Jill, a mysterious blue-haired woman who is not quite human, as his mate. However, their plans are complicated by the interference of a corrupt eugenics company that wants to capture Jill for experiments, and a mysterious pyramid that hovers over New York City.
 
Immortal (Ad Vitam) was one of the first films to use a digital backlot technique, which means that the actors were filmed in front of blue or green screens and the backgrounds were added later with computer graphics. The film also used motion capture technology to animate some of the characters, such as Horus and Anubis. The film's visual style is influenced by Bilal's comic book art, which mixes realistic and surreal elements.
