## What is 1D Stock Cutter 2.95?
 
1D Stock Cutter 2.95 is the latest version of the 1D Stock Cutter software developed by Astrokettle Algorithms[^1^]. It is a length cutting optimizer that can solve the one-dimensional stock cutting / bin packing problem: optimizes the distribution of a large number of pieces (parts) having mostly different lengths among a number of uniform or different stock lengths/sizes[^1^]. The main goal is to minimize either the overall material waste or the associated material cost. According to the developer, 1D Stock Cutter can reduce material waste by a factor of 10 (from about 10% to about 1%) compared to manual cut planning[^1^]. The program run time is around 1 - 100 seconds depending on the number of items involved and CPU speed[^1^].
 
## What are the features of 1D Stock Cutter 2.95?
 
Some of the features of 1D Stock Cutter 2.95 are[^1^]:
 
- customizable optimization goal;
- customizable cutting/technology settings;
- support for stock material inventory;
- support for part order/reference lists;
- automatic update of the inventory lists;
- data import and export in many formats;
- Metric and Imperial length/size units;
- easy installation / uninstallation;
- graphical output and complete reports.

## How to use 1D Stock Cutter 2.95?
 
To use 1D Stock Cutter 2.95, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install the program from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. The free version has some limitations on the number of items and patterns, but you can upgrade to the full version for $120.
2. Launch the program and open the Task Page. This is the main program control center that allows you to create a new task, open a stored task file, enter or modify task initial data, activate calculator run, check resulting cutting layouts (patterns) and main totals[^1^].
3. Enter or import your stock material data and your piece (part) data in the corresponding tables. You can use decimal or fraction formats, Metric or Imperial units, and copy/paste data from Excel or Access tables[^1^]. You can also use your domestic stock inventory lists or your piece samples (part reference) lists from the Stock Page[^1^].
4. Select your optimization goal (minimize waste or cost) and your cutting/technology settings (cut width, saw kerf, trim cut, etc.) from the drop-down menus at the bottom of the Task Page[^1^].
5. Click on the Run button to start the optimization process. The program will display a progress bar and a status message while calculating the best cutting patterns for your task[^1^].
6. When the calculation is finished, you can check the resulting cutting layouts (patterns) on the Image Page. This page presents a visual illustration of the layouts in an intuitive and adjustable format. You can arrange both Task and Image pages on the screen, modify task initial data, and repeat solver runs without closing Image page â it will follow the new solutions immediately[^1^].
7. You can also check the main totals (number of patterns, total length/cost/waste) on the Task Page or on a separate report window. You can export or print these reports for further analysis or documentation[^1^ 8cf37b1e13
