LibreOffice and re-lab, two open source projects, collaborated in 2012 to create libcdr, a software library that can read and parse CDR files from CorelDRAW versions 7 to X3, as well as CMX files, which are Corel's proprietary format for exchanging vector graphics.[68] The library supports a wide range of features and properties for shapes, such as color management, spot colors, gradients, patterns, and transparency.[69] It also has a basic support for text formatting and layout. The library can convert CDR and CMX files to SVG, a standard vector graphics format, and writerperfect, another open source package, can convert them to OpenDocument, an open standard for office documents. LibreOffice, a popular free office suite, uses libcdr to import CDR and CMX files since version 3.6,[70] and other applications can also use the library through its public API. CorelDRAW is a vector graphics editor that gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface and fast rendering performance. It competed with Adobe Illustrator, another vector graphics editor. However, CorelDRAW had some problems with displaying Devanagari fonts correctly.
