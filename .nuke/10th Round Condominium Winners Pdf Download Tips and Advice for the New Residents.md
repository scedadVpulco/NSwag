The condominium housing program in Addis Ababa is a government initiative that aims to provide affordable and quality housing for low and middle-income residents of the city. The program was launched in 2005 and has since constructed and distributed more than 200,000 units across different sites in the city. The program operates on a cost-sharing basis, where the beneficiaries pay a certain percentage of the total cost of the units, while the government subsidizes the rest.
 
The condominium units are allocated through a lottery system, where registered applicants are randomly selected and assigned to different sites and schemes. The lottery draws are held periodically, depending on the availability of the units and the demand of the applicants. The 10th round condominium lottery draw was one of the largest and most anticipated draws in the history of the program, as it included a significant number of units that were completed or near completion.
 
The 10th round condominium lottery draw was also notable for its inclusion of some new features and improvements in the design and quality of the units. For instance, some of the units had balconies, elevators, parking spaces, and improved finishing materials. Moreover, some of the sites had better access to infrastructure and services, such as roads, water, electricity, schools, health centers, and markets. The 10th round condominium lottery draw was a milestone for the program and a great opportunity for many residents of Addis Ababa to own their own homes.
